Develop a Java program that demonstrates the concept of exception chaining and custom exceptions. The program should include a 
method named stringInput() that prompts the user to input a string. If the string is all capital letters, all small letters, or 
contains more than one word (indicated by a space), a custom exception CustomException should be thrown with a specific message for 
each case. If the string does not meet these conditions, print the string to the console. If a CustomException is thrown, catch it 
and use it to initialize a new IOException with a specific message. This new exception should then be chained with the original 
exception using the initCause method. The chained exception should then be thrown and caught in the main method, where the message of 
the new exception and the original cause should be printed to the console.
