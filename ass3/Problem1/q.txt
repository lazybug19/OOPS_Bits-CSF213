Question 1

Create a Generic Java class called Sorter which can take an array of Integers, Doubles or Strings in the constructor(s). 
Write Lambda Expressions (block or single line) to define sorting for the array defined above:
Sorting order is: Dictionary order for Strings, and ascending order for Integers or Doubles. 
You may use any sorting algorithm(s). Execution time will be an evaluation criteria. You are not allowed to use any sorting functions 
from pre-existing libraries. Pass the Lambda Expression as an argument to a Sorter.sort() method to execute the sorting. There should 
be only one sort() method in the Sorter class.

Input: 
A filename will be passed as a commandline argument to the main method. The file will have the type of data mentioned in the first line. 
In the second line the file will contain a space separated list of literals of the specified data type (all Strings will be one-word long)
Example 1:
Integer
3 90 8 26 17

Example 2:
String

Output:
A space separated list of the sorted literals based on the sorting criteria for the data type. The output should not contain any leading 
or trailing whitespaces.
Example 1:
3 8 26 90 127
