Implement a Java program with a Main class containing a main() method, which is responsible for the program's execution flow. 
Take an integer array nums and an integer k as input from the user and it should invoke a method defined in a Solution class 
named divide().

This method takes an integer array nums and an integer k as parameters, and its goal is to split the nums array into k non-empty 
subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized.

The method should return the minimized largest sum of the split. The result returned by the divide() method should be printed within 
the main() method.

Note a subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
1 <= k <= min(50, nums.length)
